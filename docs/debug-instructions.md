# Debug Instructions for Unified Image Editor

## Quick Test Steps

1. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

2. **Navigate to FlyerPro page**:
   - If you're not logged in, you should see the landing page
   - If you're logged in, go to the FlyerPro section

3. **Click the "Try Editor" button** in the Design Editor card
   - You should see an alert saying "Try Editor button clicked! Opening Advanced Editor..."
   - If you don't see this alert, the click handler isn't working

4. **Check browser console** (Press F12):
   - Look for any red error messages
   - You should see: `üé® handleDesignEditor called!`
   - You should see: `üé® Opening Unified Image Editor`

## Alternative Test Method

If the button doesn't work in FlyerPro, try the standalone test:

1. **Open browser console** (F12)
2. **Run this command**:
   ```javascript
   window.location.href = window.location.origin + '/?view=editor-test'
   ```
3. **Click the "Launch Unified Editor" button**

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Button click does nothing
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors. The most common issues are:
- Import errors (missing components)
- Polotno SDK loading issues
- State management conflicts

### Issue: "Cannot find module" errors
**Solution**: Run in terminal:
```bash
npm install polotno react-zoom-pan-pinch localforage jszip
```

### Issue: Editor loads but shows blank screen
**Solution**: This is usually a CSS issue. The editor uses absolute positioning and full viewport height.

### Issue: Editor loads but crashes on interaction
**Solution**: This is usually related to Polotno SDK initialization. Check the browser console for specific errors.

## What Should Happen When Working

1. Click "Try Editor" button
2. See alert popup
3. FlyerPro page disappears
4. Unified Image Editor appears with:
   - Dark theme interface
   - Top toolbar with "Advanced Image Editor" title
   - Mode selector: Design | AI Beautify | Inpaint
   - Credit counter showing "50 credits"
   - Canvas area powered by Polotno
   - Save/Export/Close buttons

## Testing Features

Once the editor loads:

1. **Upload Image**: Click üìÅ button to upload an image
2. **Switch Modes**: Click on AI Beautify or Inpaint modes
3. **Try AI Features**: In AI mode, click preset buttons (will simulate processing)
4. **Check Credits**: Credits should decrease after AI operations
5. **Save/Export**: Test save and export functionality
6. **Close**: Should return to FlyerPro page

## Debugging Commands

Run these in browser console to debug:

```javascript
// Check if components are loaded
console.log(window.React);

// Check if editor is in state
// (This would need to be run when FlyerPro is visible)
```

## Need Help?

If you're still having issues:
1. Check the browser console for specific error messages
2. Try the alternative test method above
3. Verify all dependencies are installed
4. Make sure the development server is running (`npm start`)

The editor system is complex but should work once all components are properly loaded!
