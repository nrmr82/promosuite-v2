# Account Deletion Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive account deletion feature for PromoSuite V2 that allows users to permanently delete their accounts and all associated data through a secure, two-step confirmation process.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Delete Account Modal Component (`src/components/DeleteAccountModal.jsx`)
- **Two-step confirmation process**:
  - Step 1: Warning with data impact summary and understanding checkbox
  - Step 2: Type "DELETE" confirmation with final warnings
- **Loading states** during deletion process
- **Comprehensive data deletion warning** listing all affected data types
- **Alternative suggestions** (export data, cancel subscription, contact support)
- **Accessible design** with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Responsive styling** consistent with app theme

### 2. Account Deletion Service (`src/services/accountDeletionService.js`)
- **User eligibility verification** before deletion
- **Orchestrates complete deletion flow** with auth service
- **Automatic logout** after successful deletion
- **Error handling** with user-friendly messages
- **Automatic redirect** to home page after deletion
- **Proper cleanup** of user session and local data

### 3. Extended Auth Service (`src/services/authService.js`)
- **Complete data deletion** from all user-related database tables:
  - `user_analytics` (usage history)
  - `user_media` (uploaded files and assets)
  - `user_posts` (social media posts and templates)
  - `user_flyers` (flyers and designs)
  - `user_collections` (organized content collections)
  - `user_subscriptions` (billing and subscription data)
  - `user_profiles` (personal and professional information)
- **Supabase Auth user deletion** (complete account removal)
- **Local storage and session cleanup**
- **Comprehensive error handling** with detailed logging
- **Transaction-like approach** (stops on first error to prevent partial deletion)

### 4. Settings Page Integration (`src/pages/Settings.js`)
- **Delete Account button** in Account Management section
- **Export Data button** (placeholder for future implementation)
- **Modal integration** with proper state management
- **Error feedback** and loading states
- **Eligibility checking** before showing deletion modal

### 5. Styling (`src/components/DeleteAccountModal.css`)
- **Danger-themed design** with red accents for destructive actions
- **Two-step visual progression** with clear step indicators
- **Loading animations** and progress indicators
- **Responsive layout** for mobile and desktop
- **Accessibility considerations** (focus states, contrast ratios)
- **Consistent with app design system** (typography, spacing, colors)

## User Experience Flow

1. **Access**: User navigates to Settings page
2. **Initiate**: Clicks "Delete Account" button in Account Management section
3. **Warning**: Modal opens showing comprehensive data deletion warning
4. **Understanding**: User must check "I understand" checkbox to proceed
5. **Confirmation**: Step 2 requires typing "DELETE" to enable final button
6. **Processing**: Loading state shows deletion progress with clear messaging
7. **Completion**: Automatic logout and redirect to home page
8. **Result**: All user data and account completely removed from system

## Security Features

- **Two-step confirmation** prevents accidental deletions
- **Eligibility verification** ensures proper user authentication
- **Complete data removal** from all database tables and auth system
- **Secure session cleanup** removing all local traces
- **Error handling** prevents partial deletions
- **Audit logging** for monitoring and compliance

## Database Impact

The deletion process removes data from these tables in order:
1. `user_analytics` - Usage statistics and activity logs
2. `user_media` - Uploaded images, files, and media assets
3. `user_posts` - Social media posts and templates
4. `user_flyers` - Flyer designs and projects
5. `user_collections` - Organized content collections
6. `user_subscriptions` - Billing and subscription information
7. `user_profiles` - Personal and professional profile data
8. **Supabase Auth** - Authentication account and credentials

## Error Handling

- **Network errors**: Graceful handling with user-friendly messages
- **Partial failures**: Transaction-like approach stops on first error
- **Authentication errors**: Proper validation before deletion attempt
- **Database errors**: Detailed logging for debugging while showing simple user messages
- **Unexpected errors**: Catch-all handling with fallback error messages
