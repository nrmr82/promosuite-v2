## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Sidebar Not Showing?**

1. **Check browser console** (F12) for any errors
2. **Verify you're logged in** - sidebar only shows for authenticated users
3. **Hard refresh** - Ctrl+F5 or Ctrl+Shift+R
4. **Clear localStorage** if needed: `localStorage.clear()` in console

### **Navigation Not Working?**

1. **Check console logs** - should see "Sidebar navigation: ..." messages
2. **Verify user authentication** - some routes require login
3. **Check currentView state** in React DevTools if available

### **Styling Issues?**

1. **Colors should match** your existing blue (#0ea5e9) and purple (#d946ef) theme
2. **Font should be Inter** (your existing brand font)
3. **All responsive breakpoints** should work smoothly
